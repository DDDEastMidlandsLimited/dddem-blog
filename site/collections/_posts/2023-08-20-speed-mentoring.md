Are you passionate about guiding and empowering individuals in their professional journey? Are you ready to share your insights and experiences to help shape the next generation of talent? If so, we invite you to be a part of the <strong>DDD East Midlands Speed Mentoring Event</strong> on <strong>Friday, 6th October, from 6:00 PM to 9:00 PM</strong>, in the heart of Nottingham city centre.


<h3>What to Expect:</h3>

Our informal event is designed to bring mentors and mentees together in a dynamic and engaging environment. We believe that meaningful connections can be made in a short period of time, which is why we've organised three short and snappy mentoring sessions. These sessions offer a chance for mentors and mentees to connect on a personal level and exchange valuable insights.


<h3>Event Highlights:</h3>

<ul>
	<li><strong>3 Informative Sessions:</strong> Engage in three focused mentoring sessions that allow you to make an impact in a brief timeframe.</li>
	<li><strong>Networking and Refreshments:</strong> Connect with fellow mentors and mentees over refreshments, creating a vibrant atmosphere for exchange.</li>
	<li><strong>Share Your Wisdom:</strong> This is your opportunity to offer guidance, motivation, and support to mentees who are eager to learn from your experiences.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What We're Looking For:</h3>

We're seeking mentors who are willing to share their knowledge and expertise across various areas of career development. Whether it's discussing general career growth, setting ambitious goals, or identifying crucial resources - your insights can make a difference.


<h3>No Prep Required:</h3>

Mentors, we want you to bring your authentic selves to the event. There's no need to prepare anything in advanceâ€”simply come with an open mind and the willingness to share your journey.
