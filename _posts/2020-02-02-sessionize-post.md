This year the DDD East Midlands Conference has a choice of 15-minute, 30-minute and 60-minute talks. We have also changed the form a little bit to help make the experience for speakers, local meetups and attendees a little bit better. 


# Sessionize

Different conferences have different methods of submission. At DDD East Midlands we are using Sessionize as the tool for submission. Sessionize has a number of features that are great for us, including the ability to anonymise submissions.

In this piece, we will talk you through how to submit a talk using this tool.

<br/>

## Logging in

<hr/>
<br/>

### <a href="https://sessionize.com/dddeastmidlands-2020/" target="_blank">1. Use this link to go to the sessionize submission page</a>

At the top right of the page click the `Log in` option. There are a number of options for signal sign-on including Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and Office 365 accounts. Classic login means that you can use an email or password of your choosing.

<br/>

<i>Log in options for Sessionize</i>
</center>
<br/>

After logging into Sessionize on this page with the means of your choice, you’ll be directed to the Call For Speakers/Call For Proposals page.

###  Once logged in, you will be redirected to the Call For Speakers for DDD East Midlands

The experience will differ between those who already have an account, and for those whom this is the first time filling in these details. If you have an account already, a lot of your details will be pre-filled.

<br/>

## Let’s walk through the Session Fields

<hr/>
<br/>

These fields will reset for each talk description submitted

- #### Session title:
What it says on the tin. The title of your proposed talk.

- #### Description:
The description of your talk. Your proposal. This is where you describe what your talk is about and sell it to the people choosing it. See <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/2019/02/08/writing-a-talk-proposal-post.html">How To Talk Part 2 - Writing a good talk proposal</a> for more information.

- #### Level:
What level of audience your talk is aimed towards. Is it high level and introductory? Does it involve some previous knowledge in the area?

<br/>

<center>
<i>Level box in Sessionize</i>
</center>
<br/>

- #### Session Format:
What length of talk would you like to submit for? This is a multiple choice question, so if you think you can adapt your talk to different lengths, you can submit for multiple style of session.

<br/>
<img src="/assets/img/2020-02-02/sessionformat.png" alt="Options for length of talk" width="100%"/>
<center>
<i>Options for length of talk on Sessionize</i>

<br/>

- #### Tags:
This is to help us organise the tracks later. What general themes does your talk meet? You can select multiple categories in this section. It helps us if you restrict it to directly applicable categories - as it will make filtering more accurate and useful.

- #### If “Other” please enter a word to describe theme:
In case we’ve missed a tag or two. We aren’t perfect.

<i>Tags box in Sessionize</i>

<br/>

- #### Notes:

Tell us about any requirements you have or anything you wish to share. For other conferences, you may want to add links to videos of other talks you’ve had previously so that the organisers they can see your presenting style. DDD East Midlands will be recording all videos so for future talks you can add these links into submissions to their conferences.

<br/>

## Now, let’s walk through the Speaker Fields

<hr/>
<br/>

These fields will create your Sessionize profile. They will be pre-populated for other submissions you make once filled in.

- #### Speaker name:
What it says on the tin. Your name will be anonymised until you are selected to speak.

- #### Speaker tagline:
One line of you. It might be your job title, it might be a cheeky line of description about you. This will be under your photo if you are selected.

<br/>

</center>
<br/>

- #### Speaker email:
This will be prepopulated based on your login. It is also the primary way DDD East Midlands will get in contact with you.

- #### Speaker biography:
Again, we will not be able to see this until you are selected for a talk. This will also not be shown to attendees when talks are being voted on. The speaker biography will be used for when talks are selected and speakers are announced. Biographies are hard. Who are you? What do you do? Look at some examples, get feedback from a friend or colleague, and try to keep it short. <a href="https://blog.dddeastmidlands.com/2019/02/23/sparkling-biographies-post.html" target="_blank">Here is a link to our blog post on writing biographies.</a>

- #### Speaker photo:
A photo of yourself. It doesn’t need to be a professional headshot, it can even be a selfie. Again, this will be hidden from both organisers and attendees. If you are selected to speak, this photo will be used on our website and social media.

- #### Social Links:
We ask for your social media links so in the event you get selected to speak we can tag you, share your blog and celebrate any online presence you have

<br/>

- #### Can we pass your details to local meetups?
In an effort to help our local meetups find amazing speakers we would like to give them your details and some overview on the talks you've submitted. Interested in speaking at an East Midlands meetup? Then please select `Yes!`

<br/>

<i>Would you like to have your details passed on to local meetups?</i>

<br/>

- #### Speaking Experience:
This is for our own statistics and will not have an effect on your overall application. We want to know the range of experience our submission process attracts to help us with future events and initiatives.

<br/>

- #### Interested in support?
There is a range of support DDD East Midlands conference offers it's speakers. Again, this will have no reflection on your application beyond if you are selected you will be contacted about any support you indicate you are interested in.

- #### Preferred Pronoun:
What is your preferred pronoun? How should we address you or refer to you as? This is to help us with any promotion around your talk if you are a selected speaker. We don't want to assume gender or identity. 

- #### Co-speakers:
Is anyone speaking with you? Please let us know!

<br/>

## What does the anonymisation look like from your end?

<hr/>
<br/>

Sessionize hides and changes details as part of anonymisation. It changes your name to a random avatar. Below is a screenshot from where we tested out the app to make sure it was right.

<br/>
