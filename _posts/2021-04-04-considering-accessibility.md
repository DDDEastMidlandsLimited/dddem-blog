From all the team, thank you for all the support you have shown the event, and to us. We have had a number of challenges in the last couple of years. We can't wait to host a fantastic event in 2021 that you will all submit to, attend and enjoy.

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to any of the team. 

Stay safe,

_Jess_
