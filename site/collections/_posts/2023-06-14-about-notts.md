## Independents

For all your graphic novel, manga, and obscure book needs. This shop is a corner of book nerd paradise.

<a href="https://fiveleavesbookshop.co.uk/" target="_blank">**Five Leaves**</a>
Hidden up an jitty (alleyway)like most of the best things in Nottingham, this book shop is fantastic for a range of literature. Want to broaden your horizons and learn? Want a new, little heard of author to read? This is the shop for you.

### Everything Else Stores

<a href="https://hopkinson21.co.uk/" target="_blank">**Hopkinsons**</a>
Where can you find antiques, pokemon cards, a barber, a tatooist, taxidermy and vinyls all in one place? Hopkinsons in Nottingham! If it's all too much to take in you can have a beverage at their bar and cafe too.

<a href="https://www.sneintonmarketavenues.com/" target="_blank">**Sneinton Market Avenues**</a>
This area has a range of local independent stores. A couple of Jess' favourites are The Watered Garden and Wolf Wytch (for all your candle and witchy needs).
