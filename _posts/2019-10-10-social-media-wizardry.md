# Introduction
---

Here we will cover some hints and tips to help your social media presence coming up to and after your talk. There are a few advantages to this:

- Improving the experience for your attendees.
- Easily seeing feedback (what hit home for your attendees).
- Saves time and effort of "on the fly" social media.
- It can take some pressure off ensuring you deliver all your content.

## Handles And Hashtags On Slides

At the top corner of all my slides I add the following:

- Hashtag and/or Twitter handle of the event I am speaking at
- My own Twitter Handle
- Sometimes a hashtag for the talk

This is a hint to the attendees what to include when they are tweeting a picture or a quote. It helps give me visibility of the tweets and also gives the event visibility of the social media activity generated from the talk.#

If you put this information at the bottom of the slide, it might get blocked by someone's head.

## Make Your Slides Available

---

Some people will benefit from having your slides before the talk. Not all slides are useful by themselves, for providing context or actual content. You may wonder why someone wants copies of your pictures.

- Some people like to make notes on printed out slides
- If there is text on your slides, some people find it easier to read off paper, or their own device than a screen.

I personally use <a href="https://noti.st/" target="_blank">Noti.st</a> for my slide hosting. It has a number of features I really like:

- **Choosing which slides you want to publish**
  
  When you upload a talk to Notist, you can select if there are certain slides you don't want to publicly share. Some of my slides would not be great out of context - sometimes publishing out of context slides can cause trouble for a speaker. As such I choose to not publish those particular slides.

- **Adding context to slides**
  
  There is the option to add notes to each slide. Maybe you would like to add summary bullet points. Maybe you would like to provide all of your speaker notes instead of publishing a blog. The world is your oyster.

- **Option to make your slides available for download**
  
  You can choose if people can download your slides, or just view them on the webpage. I always make my slides available for download, just in case there is someone who would benefit from printing the PDF.

- **Can link resources**
  
  Super useful. Everyone takes a photo of your resources slide at the end of your talk - or you promise to share them on social media, but this is a lot of effort and I know I have forgotten to do it before. On Notist you can provide links and descriptions to all your resources. One link for all those resources.

- **Can attach peoples tweets about the talk**
  
  This is a bit cheeky - but you can link people's tweets about your talk. I find this helps encourage people to come and see me speak, and even helps with the argument of why I should be accepted to speak at an event.


Others use <a href="https://www.slidedeck.com/" target="_blank">Slidedeck</a> or <a href="https://support.google.com/docs/answer/183965?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en" target="_blank">publish their Google Slides link</a>. Their are a lot of options for sharing your slides.
