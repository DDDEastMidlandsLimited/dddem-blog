We started life as a monthly meetup in 2016 in London which gave Muslims a safe space to share ideas, network and collaborate. We focus on upskilling the community through events, mentorship, programmes, and scholarships. Within the past year, we expanded our events to Manchester and went international with our Boston and Toronto chapters!


Muslamic Makers has been listed as The 100 Most Innovative Global Muslim Startups to Watch and was shortlisted for the Techwomen100 Network Shortlist (2021).


Founder, Arfah Farooq is a multiple award-winner, from top 30 London Tech Week Changemaker (2018), top 20 Women in Software Power list (2021) by Google for Startups and Makers and the top 50 Influential Women in Computer Weekly (2022).


As well as our events programme we host a vibrant online community on Slack where we're currently running our Fellowship Programme. We also recently ran a scholarship campaign for a software engineering bootcamp.
