Although the month of [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) is almost over, we're going to have a [Hacktoberfest stand at DDD East Midlands today](https://www.dddeastmidlands.com/hacktoberfest/).

As part of this, we'll be looking to promote the use of, and contribution to, Free and Open Source Software, and will be helping folks make their first foray into contributing.

There's so much Free and Open Source software that you are using day-to-day, maybe unknowingly, and getting a chance to celebrate this fact and spend some time giving back to projects is really key, especially as it can lead to you gaining confidence and allowing you to look to contribute throughout the year.

And even better, at the closing ceremony we'll be giving away a pair of these awesome Sammy the Shark slippers, courtesy of [Digital Ocean](https://digitalocean.com), to one of the contributors to this page!
