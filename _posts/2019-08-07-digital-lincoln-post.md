I am sure fellow members of the Lincolnshire tech community are looking forward to the DDDEM conference that happens in nearby Nottingham this year. I know that because there is a regular meetup in Lincoln now, <a href="https://www.digitallincoln.co.uk/" target="_blank">Digital Lincoln</a> where we are talking about it. There is promotion activity happening at our meetup and we are proud sponsors of the conference. 

Opening a blog post like that makes me reflect on the whole of the community, a little of the experience in Lincoln in recent years and what that means.

Lincoln has had a technical community for a number of years, mostly post-university, but more recently it has started to grow a bigger technical community. In 2011, the first hackathons were run in Lincoln. The first <a href="http://lincolnhack.org/" target="_blank">Lincoln Hack</a>, a community organised hackathon, and <a href="https://twitter.com/devxsconf" target="_blank">DevXS</a>, hosted by the university for students. These were great fun and not insignificant in size. However, after this, there was a bit of a hiatus. Events did occur such as the <a href="https://twitter.com/ilincoln_meet" target="_blank">iLincoln</a> meetup and Lincoln JavaScript. However, the numbers and consistency were lacking.

Until recently, when that was revived with the establishment of <a href="http://digitallincoln.co.uk/" target="_blank">Digital Lincoln</a> in 2016 and the start of <a href="http://lincolnhack.org/" target="_blank">Lincoln Hack</a> as the community became vibrant again. The hack event has been hugely successful and the meetup has seen many speakers, both from outside Lincoln and locally, share their passion and expertise with the locals and it has been inspirational to many.

I recently read <a href="https://medium.com/@loftio/what-the-tech-community-in-nottingham-means-to-me-f0fa17bb162" target="_blank">a wonderful post by a Nottingham tech community member who has got so much out of the tech community in only but a few short months</a>. I am so pleased for them and also chatted with someone who is using the power of the community to help her grow her career, which is brilliant, I so love that these opportunities are around in our industry. So, whilst not plagiarising the ideas, honestly, I was eventually inspired to finish the blog post I promised Jess and Moreton for DDDEM on that very topic, what the community can do for you or more specifically what I have observed during my involvements in tech communities, in Nottingham, Lincoln and Leicester and what it can do for your tech career. The post was commissioned a while back and has taken some time to come out but hopefully, those in any tech community, new entrants or others will get something from it and release how and why we should nurture our communities.

## So why are community and meetups important to your technical career?

#### Free tech Learning

A meetup is similar to a conference, a bridge between the experts and learners. Educationally, a meetup differs only slightly but there is undoubtedly often a difference in expert accessibility. There is a different sort of culture and the relaxed approach often means the sometimes artificial barriers we put between ourselves and speakers are removed. I have yet to meet a speaker who is not helpful, willing to chat and talk (I mean that is why they are there right) after their presentation or demo. There is, of course, lots of other learnings besides that of the speaker or collaboration between groups in a hack or demo going on.

#### The debugging power of the conversation

Whether you talk to your established friends, new members of the community for information-sharing, advice-giving, or just vent about the latest thing in tech, this process helps you put things in perspective. We work in an industry where there is no shortage of change, which can be empowering and/or bewildering. It’s good to talk and it's often the way you find the answer to that problem that has you perplexed or whose final goal you have just not reached yet. Diversity, experience and perspective change the options open to us, it helps us see problems anew, consider ideas that may go unnoticed, and fosters the kind of creativity nearly impossible to achieve in isolation.

#### Building a super team

When you're at work, you may not always get to pick your colleagues and collaborators. If you have a side project or a business of your own this is very different. If you're looking for a super team to get your project to the next level then community, whether online or local, is an ideal place to meet the collaborators that you really need. People who compliment or share your skills are aplenty and, as I have often found, in the same position looking to find the next project or willing to help. Our industry attracts a very industrious bunch.

#### Knowing who to ask

Imagine you know when you can find a StackOverflow voice assistant that actually listens, parses text correctly and returns valuable insights and much more, well that is the community. OK maybe not always accessible but a wealth of knowledge is available to you. Fortunately, organisers try as hard as we can to ensure a diverse mix of people attending these groups and I know from my experience they are not always focused on the exact topic at hand so the range of skills are extensive and experiences far-reaching.

#### Being able to help

There is a great deal of satisfaction from helping others and if that is not enough: When one person performs a good deed, it can cause a chain reaction of other altruistic acts so within a community it often pays back big time. Helping someone within the community is great, whether it's helping with a coding problem, volunteering at an event or just being there to listen - you will be surprised at the benefit both parties get.

#### Need a job

So it is simple, you get a group of people sharing common skills and employment profiles. This allows them to network, hear of other roles in different companies, hear of new opportunities, build collaborations and maybe even start businesses. Recruitment companies often present themselves at meetups too and sponsor them, widening opportunities.

#### Making others outside of the community aware

In the digital world we live in, people are not always aware of the technical and non-technical effort that goes into providing the services, sites and mobile applications we deliver. A meetup and events attract publicity and allows people to see what is happening in the space, what goes into people’s roles and businesses and the plethora of roles and diverse skills that go into this. Transparency is good, allowing people to see what we do educates people. We can share the information which will help make them more digitally savvy, cyber secure and informed. It also allows the tech community to break down any stereotypes, the industry is diverse and certainly, diversity and inclusivity in my experience is something the community works hard on so if people perceive those working in technology a certain way then they are likely ill-informed.

#### Building friendships

Tech meetups are learning opportunities sure, but they are also social gatherings to meet and build friendships among people. Friendship is good for us — there is solid scientific research behind that. Enough said.
