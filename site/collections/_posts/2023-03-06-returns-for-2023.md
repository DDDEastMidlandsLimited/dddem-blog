DDD East Midlands is returning to the Nottingham Conference Centre on Saturday 7th October 2023 - make a note in your calendar!

We will open our Call for Papers in two weeks, on Monday 20th March, so start thinking up your talk titles now.

Our Speaker Workshop will be returning this year, so if you have always wanted to give a talk but haven’t yet managed to, DDD East Midlands is a great place to start. All you need right now is a talk title and abstract that is going to excite some interest!

We can even help with that - join us in #talk-ideas on our <a href="https://dddeastmidlands.slack.com/">Slack</a> to discuss your ideas with the community and get some early input. If you haven’t joined our Slack yet get <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/dddeastmidlands/shared_invite/zt-1qnlb60n5-sYVpLzGqKS0KSH52dMuPBA">your invite</a> and join the community.

Keep an eye on our social media channels (links in the footers below, but our icon pack hasn’t got a mastodon one yet!) for announcements of our sponsors, partners and other exciting things.
