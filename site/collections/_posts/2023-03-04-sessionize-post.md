Different conferences have different methods of submission. At DDD East Midlands we are using Sessionize as the tool for submission. Sessionize has a number of features that are great for us, including the ability to anonymise submissions.

In this piece, we will talk you through how to submit a talk using this tool.

After logging into Sessionize on this page with the means of your choice, you’ll be directed to the Call For Speakers/Call For Proposals page.

## Let’s walk through each field

- #### Session title:
What it says on the tin. The title of your proposed talk.
- #### Description:
The description of your talk. Your proposal. This is where you describe what your talk is about and sell it to the people choosing it. See <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/2019/02/08/writing-a-talk-proposal-post.html">How To Talk Part 2 - Writing a good talk proposal</a> for more information.
