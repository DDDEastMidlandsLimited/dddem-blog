# The DDD East Midlands Blog.

Welcome to the repository for the DDD East Midlands Blog Page!

After much persuasion from the community, we have decided to move away from Medium and host our blogs using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). 

We chose Jekyll as it is a framework we, the organisers, are familiar with and it allows posts to be submitted in markdown, which we hope will still keep the barrier to entry low.

## Want to contribute?

We have some handy [contribution guidelines](.github/contributing.md) to help provide some guidance.

### But first....

Please read through the [Code Of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to make sure your submissions abide to it.

## Running this project locally

- First make sure you meet all the [pre-requisites for running a Jekyll project outlined on their Quickstart page](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/)
- `jekyll build` will build the project
- `jekyll serve` will serve the project, and it will be accessible at `localhost:4000` (just put that in your browsers address bar to see)
