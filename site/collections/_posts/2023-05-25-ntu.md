We in the Department of Computer Science (DCS) at Nottingham Trent University (NTU) are very excited to be involved in this years DDD! East Midlands Conference. We are looking forward to the opportunity for staff and students to meet with those working in the industry, and hopefully create future opportunities for collaboration and knowledge exchange.

DCS is a large department in the School of Science and Technology. We have over 1500 students across BSc (Hons), MSc and apprenticeship courses. We strongly believe in engaging with employers and industry representatives in order to keep our courses relevant so that our graduates are able to gain highly-skilled employment once they graduate. This career-focused approach to teaching is what leads us to involvement in the conference.

Alongside our excellent teaching record, we are also home to internationally recognised researchers, particularly in serious games, computational intelligence and security. We engage with industry partners to enable our research to be relevant and impact the wider community.
I have been to the conference in previous years, and have found it to be a very friendly and inclusive event with a wide variety of engaging talks from different people and different perspectives – I’ve struggled to narrow my vote to 10 this year! I always come away with new ideas about what our students ought to know, even if they don’t appreciate it until after graduation! It has been great to meet up with some alumni who are still in the area and engaged in the tech scene, so I’m looking forward to seeing who is there this year!
