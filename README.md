# The DDD East Midlands Blog

Welcome to the repository for the [DDD East Midlands Blog](https://blog.dddeastmidlands.com/)!

After much persuasion from the community, we have decided to move away from Medium and host our blogs using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

We chose Jekyll as it is a framework we, the organisers, are familiar with and it allows posts to be submitted in markdown, which we hope will still keep the barrier to entry low.

## Want to contribute?

We have some handy [contribution guidelines](.github/contributing.md) to help provide some guidance.

### But first....

Please read through the [Code Of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to make sure your submissions abide to it.

## Running this project locally

- First make sure you meet all the [pre-requisites for running a Jekyll project outlined on their Quickstart page](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/)
- `jekyll build` will build the project
- `jekyll serve` will serve the project, and it will be accessible at [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000/).

### Using Docker

Install docker following the [official steps here](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) and then run:
- `docker-compose up`
- docker will run `jekyll serve` so you can modify files and the site will rebuild in docker.
- The site will be accessible at [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000/).
