After a lot of thought and discussion, Moreton and I decided that it was in our best interest to walk away from organising DDD East Midlands for a while. We made efforts to find people that we could hand the event over to, but sadly each avenue we explored didn't work out. With a heavy heart, we realised that moving on from DDD East Midlands meant the end of the event in its entirety. 

## It's a bittersweet farewell.

Organising the conference was a learning experience and definitely came with some unique challenges. The very first event Moreton and I put together without the amazing team we eventually got together. We hadn't organised something of that scale before, it was a lot of effort and took up all our time up outside of work but the result was worth it. 

Probably one of the most memorable events of the first DDD East Midlands was the fire alarm going off during the first sessions, and everyone huddling together in the pouring rain. Even then, something that could have meant disaster became a talking point, something the community around the event survived together, and SO MANY of the attendees came back after the alarm (granted a bit soggy, it was raining hard) and made sure we still all had a fantastic day. 

The conferences survived some very tough times. We ran an event during COVID, and thanks to you all being understanding of the safety precautions put in place, we didn't hear of any resulting illness. The last event was run when companies were being hit hard by cost of living and recruitment had taken a downturn. This made it incredibly difficult for Rachel Watson to gather the funding needed to run the event, but it was managed.

By the third event we had a great crew, both in terms of year long organisers including Rachel (who joined our gang on the second event and helped immensely), James, Steven and Mia; as well as our fantastic volunteer crew who supported on the set up and day of the conference itself. The events wouldn't have been possible without the support of these people.

## Some brilliant outcomes of DDDEM

IT's been really interesting seeing some of the developments from these conferences. The anonymous voting meant we had to do very little to ensure a good spread of diversity across speakers. Pretty much every year the quota was nearly hit just through who was voted for and the spread of topics was fascinating as well. 

Off the back of the events, we've seen some first time or early stage speakers go on to speak at much bigger and more impressive conferences. We've heard of extra engagement and support for some of the communities we've partnered with. People have met mentors, grown their network, found jobs and made friends at the events. We've even heard of at least one person moving to Nottingham based on what they saw at DDD East Midlands (which still blows my mind).

I like to think in the few events we ran, we had some positive impact. From feedback we've had as well, plenty of you enjoyed attending and will be as sad as we are that there will be no more.

## The East Midlands Community.

The thing that makes it hard to walk away from DDD East Midlands is the amazing community that was built around it. The companies that supported us including photographers, coffee from Cartwheel, NTU (fantastic venue, catering and staff), the sponsors, the community partners and meetups and of course all those who helped make the day run successfully and everyone who attended. The East Midlands community has been supportive throughout. 

Who knows, maybe one day DDD East Midlands may come back in some form or other. Even if it's under new ownership I would be thrilled to see that happen. Sadly, for various reasons it's not something Moreton and I can do at present. We are sorry, and it was not an easy decision.

## Thank You

Because of all of you, this has turned into a tough and heartbreaking decision. Thank you for making it so hard to walk away from. I'm proud of what we achieved with these events and hope that some of the connections and friendships made at the event outlast it.

Farewell.
