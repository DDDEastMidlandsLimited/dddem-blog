<a href="https://www.nottinghamcastle.org.uk/" target="_blank">**Nottingham Castle**</a>
There is a fee to get in, but well worth the price to explore the gardens, visit the historical building and go into the Nottingham caves. If you are with your family there is a fantastic play area for the kids (and grown up kids) to enjoy as well.

## Things to do

### Boardgames

Food, drink, games and even an RPG room with sound and light effects. This is a great place to socialise with friends old and new.
