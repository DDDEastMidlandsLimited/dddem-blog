## How to contribute.

### Have a blog idea?

If you have an idea for the DDD East Midlands blog, but don't necessarily want to write it, how about raising a Blog Topic Request? The themes of this blog page are around:

- The DDD East Midlands Conference
- Speaking
- East Midlands Meetups
- The East Midlands tech community
- What is great about each tech community in the East Midlands

Think there is something missing? Raise an issue to let us know/so that we have a pool of ideas for people who want to write.

### Want to write a blog?

- The first thing I would advise is to [get in touch with the organisers](https://www.dddeastmidlands.com/contact/) to check that the content is
both suitable for the blog, but also that no one else is currently committed to writing about the same topic.
- Check out our blog post on [adding a blog post](https://blog.dddeastmidlands.com/2019/10/10/how-to-pr-with-your-post.html)
- Pull down this repository.
- Create a feature branch with a name like: `post/short-description-of-topic`
- Under the _posts folder create a markdown file with a title that follows this pattern `YYYY-MM-DD-short-title-post.md`
- Write your post in markdown.
- Raise a pull request and assign `wordshaker` (Jessica) and `moretonb` (Moreton) as reviewers
- _(We may need an extra nudge on Slack or Twitter to know your PR is there)_
- One review, Jessica will arrange a date to merge and share.
- Share your wonderful post with the world!
