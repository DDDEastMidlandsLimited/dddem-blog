<h3 class="quote"><i>Our Final Decision And How We Reached It</i> </h3>

<br/>

The DDD East Midlands team have decided that the most responsible thing to do is **postpone the DDD East Midlands Conference until 2021**. Though this has been a tough decision to make, the safety of our delegates is of the upmost importance.

# How we came to this decision

# Common questions 

We understand there will be a lot of questions around this. Hopefully, the below will answer a few of them. As always, we are here to answer any others you may have.

### What day is DDD East Midlands 2021?

Saturday 2nd October 2021.

### Can I carry over the ticket I have for 2020?

Yes. We will be closing off the ability to sign up for a ticket until next year, but any non-cancelled tickets will be carried over to 2021. 

### What happens for speakers?

We are still hosting the online virtual workshop for the speakers selected for 2020, but we have decided to re-start the talk submission and voting process for 2021. 

There are a couple of reasons for this. A lot can change in a year, and we know that often speakers like to change their topics and talks in this time frame. Further to this we want to have an opportunity for more people to put forward their submissions. It is part of our mission to support and empower people to speak at events like ours, and we are going to continue to offer opportunities to take part.

### What does this mean for sponsors?

Sponsors are being offered the opportunity to carry over their sponsorship to 2021 and to continue supporting the event. There are still more opportunities to sponsor the conference and we are taking this opportunity to reassess the sponsorship pack and come up with ideas for what we can do to make the 2021 event bigger and better than what we had planned for 2020.

# Thank you.

From all the team, thank you for all the support you have shown the event, and to us. We have had a number of challenges in the last couple of years. We can't wait to host a fantastic event that hopefully you will all submit to, attend and enjoy.

Stay safe,
