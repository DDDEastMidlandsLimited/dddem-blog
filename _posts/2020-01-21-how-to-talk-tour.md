<br/>

On the back of the success of the 2019 How To Talk tour, Moreton and Jess have booked in to meetups near you for a new and improved version for 2020.

There are a number of attendees from last year who have gone on to do their first talks in 2019. Some at local meetups, some at work and others at conferences. We are hoping to have the same happen this year, and maybe to encourage YOU to submit to DDD East Midlands as well!

<br/>

## What is the tour about?
---

We are very passionate about encouraging people to speak and to help them feel confident about putting themselves forward to present. From coming up with an idea of what you want to talk about, through to planning and engaging and informative presentation - this may be an overwhelming idea.

In these presentations we talk through hints and tips to tackle each step of presenting your ideas.

Whether it's an internal work talk, a talk at a meetup or you are thinking of submitting to a conference - hopefully you'll find something in these talks and workshops that is useful to you. The long game is to have lots of excellent presenters from the East Midlands sharing their knowledge and experience at events all around the UK, and maybe even globally. We want to show off the amazing talent and opportunity the East Midlands has.

<br/>

<strong>Date:</strong> 26th February

<strong>Target Audience:</strong> Early birds and those who have evening commitments

Bring your coffee (and maybe a mocha for Moreton and a latte for Jess). This is a shorter talk walking through the process of coming up with and developing a talk. We will be staying after for a while to answer some of your questions.

<strong>Target Audience:</strong> Those near Lincoln who are more available after work and want tips, tricks and informal Q&A

<strong>Description of event:</strong>

Again, this will mostly be in the format of our talk, guiding through each steps, but with questions, answers and informal chatter. Jess did the initial form of this talk last year in Lincoln and had a really great time.

<br/>

## What are your speaking experiences?
---

Moreton and Jessica have spoken at internal talks, meetups and conferences. Jessica is an international speaker and has a range of experiences in this area.

If you are inspired to submit to DDD East Midlands after these talks, and you get selected as a speaker there is even more opportunity to get support on your speaking journey. If supported by sponsors (the opportunity is still open) we will be hosting the Speakers Workshop by <a href="https://dylanbeattie.net/" target="_blank">Dylan Beattie</a> again this year for successful speakers. This is a full day of training on creating and presenting content. DDD East Midlands also offers mentorship for speakers who ask for it from some great local international conference speakers.

<br/>

## We are really excited to hear your questions.
---

These talks are a lot of fun to do and it's great to meet more of the community. Hopefully there is a talk that suits you in terms of format and time. If you think we are missing anywhere, let us know!

See you soon,

_Jess and Moreton._
