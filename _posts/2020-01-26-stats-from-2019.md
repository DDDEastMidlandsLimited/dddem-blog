One of the things we like to do at DDD East Midlands is to share the data we have and how we are using it. As part of running our first conference there were a few things we wanted to achieve or improve upon. We wanted:

- to encourage speakers of all experience levels to apply to the conference.
- for there to be talks available for all levels of attendee to vote upon.
- measure our gender balance of attendees so we could make efforts to improve each year.

In this post, we will share some of the stats we collected for 2019.

## Talk Submission Stats
---

In 2019 we had a fantastic level of submission from all over the UK. There were submissions from a whole scope of topics from Security to UX and management school.

<h3 class="stat"><i>128 Submissions from 66 speakers</i></h3>
</center>

One piece of feedback we had is that some people did not submit as they were intimidated by the thought of doing an hour long talk. For 2020, there is the option to submit for hour long, 30 minute and 15 minute talks. We hope this will help improve on this already impressive rate of submission.

## Attendee Stats

One of the aims we wanted to achieve was to have a mix of both professions and gender at the conference. 

### Job titles and Professions

As we expected the majority of our attendees were developers of some form or other. There was also a number of managers,Directors and Founders at the event.

There was quite a small percentage of designers, which may be expected with a number of the talks being technical.

## We are really excited to hear your questions.

These talks are a lot of fun to do and it's great to meet more of the community. Hopefully there is a talk that suits you in terms of format and time. If you think we are missing anywhere, let us know!

See you soon,

_Jess and Moreton._
