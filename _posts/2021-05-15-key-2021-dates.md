<br/>

The DDD East Midlands team have been busy bees this last few weeks prepping for what should be a great conference this year. If all goes to plan we are hoping to host an in-person tech conference at <a href="https://www.dddeastmidlands.com/information/venue-information/" target="_blank">The Nottingham Conference Center this October.</a>

We have a lot of exciting sponsors and partners to introduce you to that will make all of this possible, and as you now we are doing all we can to ensure a safe conference.

# Getting a ticket

The first batch of tickets sold out within an hour on the 14th of May, but not to worry! There is going to be a second batch of tickets released on the 28th. Tickets are all booked through Eventbrite and after the release of the second wave a wait-list will launch.

If you can no longer make the event, we ask you cancel your ticket so someone else can sign up.

## What is included in a ticket?

The conference is free and hosted on a Saturday, and there is a lot included in this free ticket:

#### Vote for the talks you want to see

Attendees get to vote on the talks they want to see. We run an democratic, anonymized process for talk selection. The talk titles and descriptions for the talks submitted are shown on the DDD East Midlands website and those with a ticket are asked to vote for their top ten talks using a Google form. 

Once voting closes, the team go through the votes ensuring each speaker only has their top voted talk scheduled. We also hold the right, if we need to, to change up to 20% of the talks for fair representations for diverse groups.

#### Opportunities to learn

On the day there will not only be great talks, but opportunities to code and a fantastic exhibition area with stalls from our brilliant sponsors.

#### Meet some excellent new people

Meet some of the brilliant local community. Last event, we had fire alarms and rainy weather which encouraged people to meet through sheltering under shared umbrellas.

This year we are hoping for no fire alarms and for better weather, but there will still be plenty of opportunity to meet, mingle and have fun.

#### Enjoy some fantastic food

There have been many positive comments about the food and coffee served at the last event. We cater for all dietary needs with some tasty hot grub to keep you fuelled throughout the day.

# What about Covid?

This last stretch of time (the never ending 2020) has been tough for us all. Rachel, Moreton and myself (the organisers of DDD East Midlands) will not run this conference unless we can do it in a way that is safe.

I am a clinically vulnerable individual, having to take immunosuppressants, and Moreton is my partner. As such we have lived in isolation for a while now and am ever nervous of the danger of Covid. With vaccinations and the actions of everyone having an impact on the spread, we are feeling more and more confident about running this event in October.

We ask that all those attending do have the vaccine if they are able, to decrease risk and increase the safety for all attending. This is difficult to enforce and there will be those who don't agree with our stance - but the safety of everyone involved is of highest importance to us.

## August decisions

By the end of August we need to let the venue know if we want to postpone the event. If it is safe to, we will run a full in-person event in October. If it is too high risk, we will postpone the event to March 2022, carrying over all talks, tickets and sponsorship.

We understand any anxiety about going to an event after all the challenges we've faced in the past year, and the anxiety of seeing people at all. We feel the same. But we have hope, and this would be great way to celebrate the return to a new normal.
