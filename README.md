# The DDD East Midlands Blog

Welcome to the repository for the [DDD East Midlands Blog](https://blog.dddeastmidlands.com/)!

After much persuasion from the community, we have decided to move away from the Medium and host our own blogs using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

We have chosen Jekyll,as it is the framework which we, the organisers are familiar with and it allows posts to be submitted in markdown, which we hope will still keep the barrier to entry low.

## Want to contribute?

We have some handy [contribution guidelines](.github/contributing.md) which whould help you,by guiding you in right path.

### But first...!!

Please go through the [Code Of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to make sure your submissions abide to it.

## Running this project locally

- First make sure you meet all the [pre-requisites for running a Jekyll project outlined on their Quickstart page](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/)
- `jekyll build` will build the project
- `jekyll serve` will serve the project, and it will be accessible at [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000/).
